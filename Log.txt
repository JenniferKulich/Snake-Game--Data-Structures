March 17 (Sunday):
	* Downloaded Hinker's startup code
	* Made a new repository (csc315_sp2019_project3)
	* Made first commit of the startup code source

March 18 (Monday):
	* Got the new tar file
	* Got the startup code compiling and running
	* Tried messing around with the code. Have code written for the zig-zag
		pattern- Hamilton patter that just works for even height board
	* Created a zig-zag pattern for an odd board. Works pretty well and long as
		there aren't a lot of blocks in the second to top row.
	* I know I could condense my code a lot more, but I know I can't keep using
		this strategy- I only used it to get used to the code base and how things
		worked. Works well enough for checkpoint 1.

March 19 (Tuesday):
	* Cleaned up the code I wasn't using
	* Waiting to change strategy until we go over more stuff in class

March 23 (Saturday):
	* fixed the driver issue
	* ran the average score
	* going to try to implement a graph

March 24 (Sunday)
	* Add the graph class from the homework.
